# Rubycon

## Introduction

This repository holds nothing fancy, it's just some fun and experimentation with Ruby.

## Setting up

This repository uses `rbenv` -- [set this up first](https://gist.github.com/andrew-h-lee/dd58258b98b73e9cbe9c). You can find additional information [here](https://www.develves.net/blogs/asd/2016-03-17-using-virtual-environments-ruby-1/).

It also uses Ruby [bundler](https://bundler.io/) to specify dependencies. Run `bundle install` to install dependencies.
