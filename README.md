# Rubycon

## Introduction

This repository holds nothing fancy, it's just some fun and experimentation with Ruby.

## Setting up

This repository uses `rbenv` -- [set this up first](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv). You can find additional information [here](https://www.develves.net/blogs/asd/2016-03-17-using-virtual-environments-ruby-1/).

It also uses Ruby [bundler](https://bundler.io/) to specify dependencies. If you don't have `bundler`, run `gem install bundler` in the appropriate directory with the right `.ruby-version`. Subsquently, run `bundle install` to install dependencies.
